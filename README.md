# Stock-Price-Dashboard-Web-GUI-Test-

Introduction:
In my project, I use React.js as the frontend service and Express.js (Node.js) as the backend 
server to provide API services.
I also used mongoDB as the backend database to store the historical stock price data.

To start the frontend service,
1. go to frontend/reactapp
2. type command "npm start" in a terminal

To start the backend service,
1. go to backend folder
2. type command "npm start" in a terminal

Also, to start the database,
1. go to backend/mongodb-osx-x86_64-4.0.8/
2. type command "./bin/mongod --dppath ../data" in a terminal
